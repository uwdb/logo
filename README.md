## Style Guide

Consistently following set of guidelines for logo use will make our "brand" memorable and professional, and is standard industry practice. Please try to follow the guidelines and make no drastic edits to the logo files.

* Color version
	* The purple and gold UWDB logo was designed for and looks best on a white background. When using the full color version, make sure to use it on white or near-white backgrounds. On backgrounds that are off-white, creating a rounded white box around the logo will keep the clean look.


* Monochrome version
	* When a bounding box over a color background is impossible, consider using the monochrome version of the logo. I've provided monochrome white, black, and bright gold versions which will stand out against most background colors. 


## Logo Files

For each logo variant, there are three files:

*  .png
	* This is the file to use if you want a traditional image file which can be cropped, resized, and converted to gif and jpg as necessasary. The dimensions are large so that the art will print cleanly if used on a poster.
	
* .svg
	* This is a vector graphics version which works with certain web formats.
	
* .psd
	* I included a psd (Adobe Photoshop file) for easy handin to a print shop for example.
	
	
In addition, there are source files for in ai (Adobe Illustrator) and pdf formats.

## Fonts and Colors

The fonts used in this design do not have an open license; we own only the logo image. A text font for "University of Washington Database Group" was not included in the logo design. For the UWDB t-shirts, I used the font 

The colors used for the multi-color logo are UW purple (#39275B) and gold (#C79900). For more details on UW branding see [the university brand guildlines](http://www.washington.edu/marketing/university-brand-guidelines/). The monochrome gold version uses a brighter gold: #FFBC00.
